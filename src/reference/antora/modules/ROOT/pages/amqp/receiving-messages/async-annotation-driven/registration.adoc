= Programmatic Endpoint Registration

`RabbitListenerEndpoint` provides a model of a Rabbit endpoint and is responsible for configuring the container for that model.
The infrastructure lets you configure endpoints programmatically in addition to the ones that are detected by the `RabbitListener` annotation.
The following example shows how to do so:

[source,java]
----
@Configuration
@EnableRabbit
public class AppConfig implements RabbitListenerConfigurer {

    @Override
    public void configureRabbitListeners(RabbitListenerEndpointRegistrar registrar) {
        SimpleRabbitListenerEndpoint endpoint = new SimpleRabbitListenerEndpoint();
        endpoint.setQueueNames("anotherQueue");
        endpoint.setMessageListener(message -> {
            // processing
        });
        registrar.registerEndpoint(endpoint);
    }
}
----

In the preceding example, we used `SimpleRabbitListenerEndpoint`, which provides the actual `MessageListener` to invoke, but you could just as well build your own endpoint variant to describe a custom invocation mechanism.

It should be noted that you could just as well skip the use of `@RabbitListener` altogether and register your endpoints programmatically through `RabbitListenerConfigurer`.

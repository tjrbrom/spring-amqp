= Proxy `@RabbitListener` and Generics

If your service is intended to be proxied (for example, in the case of `@Transactional`), you should keep in mind some considerations when
the interface has generic parameters.
Consider the following example:

[source, java]
----
interface TxService<P> {

   String handle(P payload, String header);

}

static class TxServiceImpl implements TxService<Foo> {

    @Override
    @RabbitListener(...)
    public String handle(Thing thing, String rk) {
         ...
    }

}
----

With a generic interface and a particular implementation, you are forced to switch to the CGLIB target class proxy because the actual implementation of the interface
`handle` method is a bridge method.
In the case of transaction management, the use of CGLIB is configured by using
an annotation option: `@EnableTransactionManagement(proxyTargetClass = true)`.
And in this case, all annotations have to be declared on the target method in the implementation, as the following example shows:

[source, java]
----
static class TxServiceImpl implements TxService<Foo> {

    @Override
    @Transactional
    @RabbitListener(...)
    public String handle(@Payload Foo foo, @Header("amqp_receivedRoutingKey") String rk) {
        ...
    }

}

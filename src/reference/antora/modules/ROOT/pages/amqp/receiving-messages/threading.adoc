= Threading and Asynchronous Consumers

A number of different threads are involved with asynchronous consumers.

Threads from the `TaskExecutor` configured in the `SimpleMessageListenerContainer` are used to invoke the `MessageListener` when a new message is delivered by `RabbitMQ Client`.
If not configured, a `SimpleAsyncTaskExecutor` is used.
If you use a pooled executor, you need to ensure the pool size is sufficient to handle the configured concurrency.
With the `DirectMessageListenerContainer`, the `MessageListener` is invoked directly on a `RabbitMQ Client` thread.
In this case, the `taskExecutor` is used for the task that monitors the consumers.

NOTE: When using the default `SimpleAsyncTaskExecutor`, for the threads the listener is invoked on, the listener container `beanName` is used in the `threadNamePrefix`.
This is useful for log analysis.
We generally recommend always including the thread name in the logging appender configuration.
When a `TaskExecutor` is specifically provided through the `taskExecutor` property on the container, it is used as is, without modification.
It is recommended that you use a similar technique to name the threads created by a custom `TaskExecutor` bean definition, to aid with thread identification in log messages.

The `Executor` configured in the `CachingConnectionFactory` is passed into the `RabbitMQ Client` when creating the connection, and its threads are used to deliver new messages to the listener container.
If this is not configured, the client uses an internal thread pool executor with (at the time of writing) a pool size of `Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors() * 2` for each connection.

If you have a large number of factories or are using `CacheMode.CONNECTION`, you may wish to consider using a shared `ThreadPoolTaskExecutor` with enough threads to satisfy your workload.

IMPORTANT: With the `DirectMessageListenerContainer`, you need to ensure that the connection factory is configured with a task executor that has sufficient threads to support your desired concurrency across all listener containers that use that factory.
The default pool size (at the time of writing) is `Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors() * 2`.

The `RabbitMQ client` uses a `ThreadFactory` to create threads for low-level I/O (socket) operations.
To modify this factory, you need to configure the underlying RabbitMQ `ConnectionFactory`, as discussed in xref:amqp/connections.adoc#connection-factory[Configuring the Underlying Client Connection Factory].

= Consumer Events

The containers publish application events whenever a listener
(consumer) experiences a failure of some kind.
The event `ListenerContainerConsumerFailedEvent` has the following properties:

* `container`: The listener container where the consumer experienced the problem.
* `reason`: A textual reason for the failure.
* `fatal`: A boolean indicating whether the failure was fatal.
With non-fatal exceptions, the container tries to restart the consumer, according to the `recoveryInterval` or `recoveryBackoff` (for the `SimpleMessageListenerContainer`) or the `monitorInterval` (for the `DirectMessageListenerContainer`).
* `throwable`: The `Throwable` that was caught.

These events can be consumed by implementing `ApplicationListener<ListenerContainerConsumerFailedEvent>`.

NOTE: System-wide events (such as connection failures) are published by all consumers when `concurrentConsumers` is greater than 1.

If a consumer fails because one if its queues is being used exclusively, by default, as well as publishing the event, a `DEBUG` log is issued (since 3.1, previously WARN).
To change this logging behavior, provide a custom `ConditionalExceptionLogger` in the `AbstractMessageListenerContainer` instance's `exclusiveConsumerExceptionLogger` property.
In addition, the `SimpleMessageListenerContainer` consumer restart after such an exception is now logged at DEBUG level by default (previously INFO).
A new method `logRestart()` has been added to the `ConditionalExceptionLogger` to allow this to be changed.

Also, the `AbstractMessageListenerContainer.DefaultExclusiveConsumerLogger` is now public, allowing it to be sub classed.

Fatal errors are always logged at the `ERROR` level.
This it not modifiable.

Several other events are published at various stages of the container lifecycle:

* `AsyncConsumerStartedEvent`: When the consumer is started.
* `AsyncConsumerRestartedEvent`: When the consumer is restarted after a failure - `SimpleMessageListenerContainer` only.
* `AsyncConsumerTerminatedEvent`: When a consumer is stopped normally.
* `AsyncConsumerStoppedEvent`: When the consumer is stopped - `SimpleMessageListenerContainer` only.
* `ConsumeOkEvent`: When a `consumeOk` is received from the broker, contains the queue name and `consumerTag`
* `ListenerContainerIdleEvent`: See xref:amqp/receiving-messages/idle-containers.adoc[Detecting Idle Asynchronous Consumers].
* `MissingQueueEvent`: When a missing queue is detected.

= Reply Management

The existing support in `MessageListenerAdapter` already lets your method have a non-void return type.
When that is the case, the result of the invocation is encapsulated in a message sent to the address specified in the `ReplyToAddress` header of the original message, or to the default address configured on the listener.
You can set that default address by using the `@SendTo` annotation of the messaging abstraction.

Assuming our `processOrder` method should now return an `OrderStatus`, we can write it as follows to automatically send a reply:

[source,java]
----
@RabbitListener(destination = "myQueue")
@SendTo("status")
public OrderStatus processOrder(Order order) {
    // order processing
    return status;
}
----

If you need to set additional headers in a transport-independent manner, you could return a `Message` instead, something like the following:

[source,java]
----

@RabbitListener(destination = "myQueue")
@SendTo("status")
public Message<OrderStatus> processOrder(Order order) {
    // order processing
    return MessageBuilder
        .withPayload(status)
        .setHeader("code", 1234)
        .build();
}
----

Alternatively, you can use a `MessagePostProcessor` in the `beforeSendReplyMessagePostProcessors` container factory property to add more headers.
Starting with version 2.2.3, the called bean/method is made available in the reply message, which can be used in a message post processor to communicate the information back to the caller:

[source, java]
----
factory.setBeforeSendReplyPostProcessors(msg -> {
    msg.getMessageProperties().setHeader("calledBean",
            msg.getMessageProperties().getTargetBean().getClass().getSimpleName());
    msg.getMessageProperties().setHeader("calledMethod",
            msg.getMessageProperties().getTargetMethod().getName());
    return m;
});
----

Starting with version 2.2.5, you can configure a `ReplyPostProcessor` to modify the reply message before it is sent; it is called after the `correlationId` header has been set up to match the request.

[source, java]
----
@RabbitListener(queues = "test.header", group = "testGroup", replyPostProcessor = "echoCustomHeader")
public String capitalizeWithHeader(String in) {
    return in.toUpperCase();
}

@Bean
public ReplyPostProcessor echoCustomHeader() {
    return (req, resp) -> {
        resp.getMessageProperties().setHeader("myHeader", req.getMessageProperties().getHeader("myHeader"));
        return resp;
    };
}
----

Starting with version 3.0, you can configure the post processor on the container factory instead of on the annotation.

[source, java]
----
factory.setReplyPostProcessorProvider(id -> (req, resp) -> {
    resp.getMessageProperties().setHeader("myHeader", req.getMessageProperties().getHeader("myHeader"));
    return resp;
});
----

The `id` parameter is the listener id.

A setting on the annotation will supersede the factory setting.

The `@SendTo` value is assumed as a reply `exchange` and `routingKey` pair that follows the `exchange/routingKey` pattern,
where one of those parts can be omitted.
The valid values are as follows:

* `thing1/thing2`: The `replyTo` exchange and the `routingKey`.
`thing1/`: The `replyTo` exchange and the default (empty) `routingKey`.
`thing2` or `/thing2`: The `replyTo` `routingKey` and the default (empty) exchange.
`/` or empty: The `replyTo` default exchange and the default `routingKey`.

Also, you can use `@SendTo` without a `value` attribute.
This case is equal to an empty `sendTo` pattern.
`@SendTo` is used only if the inbound message does not have a `replyToAddress` property.

Starting with version 1.5, the `@SendTo` value can be a bean initialization SpEL Expression, as shown in the following example:

[source, java]
----
@RabbitListener(queues = "test.sendTo.spel")
@SendTo("#{spelReplyTo}")
public String capitalizeWithSendToSpel(String foo) {
    return foo.toUpperCase();
}
...
@Bean
public String spelReplyTo() {
    return "test.sendTo.reply.spel";
}
----

The expression must evaluate to a `String`, which can be a simple queue name (sent to the default exchange) or with
the form `exchange/routingKey` as discussed prior to the preceding example.

NOTE: The `#{...}` expression is evaluated once, during initialization.

For dynamic reply routing, the message sender should include a `reply_to` message property or use the alternate
runtime SpEL expression (described after the next example).

Starting with version 1.6, the `@SendTo` can be a SpEL expression that is evaluated at runtime against the request
and reply, as the following example shows:

[source, java]
----
@RabbitListener(queues = "test.sendTo.spel")
@SendTo("!{'some.reply.queue.with.' + result.queueName}")
public Bar capitalizeWithSendToSpel(Foo foo) {
    return processTheFooAndReturnABar(foo);
}
----

The runtime nature of the SpEL expression is indicated with `!{...}` delimiters.
The evaluation context `#root` object for the expression has three properties:

* `request`: The `o.s.amqp.core.Message` request object.
* `source`: The `o.s.messaging.Message<?>` after conversion.
* `result`: The method result.

The context has a map property accessor, a standard type converter, and a bean resolver, which lets other beans in the
context be referenced (for example, `@someBeanName.determineReplyQ(request, result)`).

In summary, `#{...}` is evaluated once during initialization, with the `#root` object being the application context.
Beans are referenced by their names.
`!{...}` is evaluated at runtime for each message, with the root object having the properties listed earlier.
Beans are referenced with their names, prefixed by `@`.

Starting with version 2.1, simple property placeholders are also supported (for example, `${some.reply.to}`).
With earlier versions, the following can be used as a work around, as the following example shows:

[source, java]
----
@RabbitListener(queues = "foo")
@SendTo("#{environment['my.send.to']}")
public String listen(Message in) {
    ...
    return ...
}

= Polling Consumer

The `AmqpTemplate` itself can be used for polled `Message` reception.
By default, if no message is available, `null` is returned immediately.
There is no blocking.
Starting with version 1.5, you can set a `receiveTimeout`, in milliseconds, and the receive methods block for up to that long, waiting for a message.
A value less than zero means block indefinitely (or at least until the connection to the broker is lost).
Version 1.6 introduced variants of the `receive` methods that allows the timeout be passed in on each call.

CAUTION: Since the receive operation creates a new `QueueingConsumer` for each message, this technique is not really appropriate for high-volume environments.
Consider using an asynchronous consumer or a `receiveTimeout` of zero for those use cases.

Starting with version 2.4.8, when using a non-zero timeout, you can specify arguments passed into the `basicConsume` method used to associate the consumer with the channel.
For example: `template.addConsumerArg("x-priority", 10)`.

There are four simple `receive` methods available.
As with the `Exchange` on the sending side, there is a method that requires that a default queue property has been set
directly on the template itself, and there is a method that accepts a queue parameter at runtime.
Version 1.6 introduced variants to accept `timeoutMillis` to override `receiveTimeout` on a per-request basis.
The following listing shows the definitions of the four methods:

[source,java]
----
Message receive() throws AmqpException;

Message receive(String queueName) throws AmqpException;

Message receive(long timeoutMillis) throws AmqpException;

Message receive(String queueName, long timeoutMillis) throws AmqpException;
----

As in the case of sending messages, the `AmqpTemplate` has some convenience methods for receiving POJOs instead of `Message` instances, and implementations provide a way to customize the `MessageConverter` used to create the `Object` returned:
The following listing shows those methods:

[source,java]
----
Object receiveAndConvert() throws AmqpException;

Object receiveAndConvert(String queueName) throws AmqpException;

Object receiveAndConvert(long timeoutMillis) throws AmqpException;

Object receiveAndConvert(String queueName, long timeoutMillis) throws AmqpException;
----

Starting with version 2.0, there are variants of these methods that take an additional `ParameterizedTypeReference` argument to convert complex types.
The template must be configured with a `SmartMessageConverter`.
See xref:amqp/message-converters.adoc#json-complex[Converting From a `Message` With `RabbitTemplate`] for more information.

Similar to `sendAndReceive` methods, beginning with version 1.3, the `AmqpTemplate` has several convenience `receiveAndReply` methods for synchronously receiving, processing and replying to messages.
The following listing shows those method definitions:

[source,java]
----
<R, S> boolean receiveAndReply(ReceiveAndReplyCallback<R, S> callback)
       throws AmqpException;

<R, S> boolean receiveAndReply(String queueName, ReceiveAndReplyCallback<R, S> callback)
     throws AmqpException;

<R, S> boolean receiveAndReply(ReceiveAndReplyCallback<R, S> callback,
    String replyExchange, String replyRoutingKey) throws AmqpException;

<R, S> boolean receiveAndReply(String queueName, ReceiveAndReplyCallback<R, S> callback,
    String replyExchange, String replyRoutingKey) throws AmqpException;

<R, S> boolean receiveAndReply(ReceiveAndReplyCallback<R, S> callback,
     ReplyToAddressCallback<S> replyToAddressCallback) throws AmqpException;

<R, S> boolean receiveAndReply(String queueName, ReceiveAndReplyCallback<R, S> callback,
            ReplyToAddressCallback<S> replyToAddressCallback) throws AmqpException;
----

The `AmqpTemplate` implementation takes care of the `receive` and `reply` phases.
In most cases, you should provide only an implementation of `ReceiveAndReplyCallback` to perform some business logic for the received message and build a reply object or message, if needed.
Note, a `ReceiveAndReplyCallback` may return `null`.
In this case, no reply is sent and `receiveAndReply` works like the `receive` method.
This lets the same queue be used for a mixture of messages, some of which may not need a reply.

Automatic message (request and reply) conversion is applied only if the provided callback is not an instance of `ReceiveAndReplyMessageCallback`, which provides a raw message exchange contract.

The `ReplyToAddressCallback` is useful for cases requiring custom logic to determine the `replyTo` address at runtime against the received message and reply from the `ReceiveAndReplyCallback`.
By default, `replyTo` information in the request message is used to route the reply.

The following listing shows an example of POJO-based receive and reply:

[source,java]
----
boolean received =
        this.template.receiveAndReply(ROUTE, new ReceiveAndReplyCallback<Order, Invoice>() {

                public Invoice handle(Order order) {
                        return processOrder(order);
                }
        });
if (received) {
        log.info("We received an order!");
}

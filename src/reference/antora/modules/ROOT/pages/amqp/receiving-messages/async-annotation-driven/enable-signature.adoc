= Annotated Endpoint Method Signature

So far, we have been injecting a simple `String` in our endpoint, but it can actually have a very flexible method signature.
The following example rewrites it to inject the `Order` with a custom header:

[source,java]
----
@Component
public class MyService {

    @RabbitListener(queues = "myQueue")
    public void processOrder(Order order, @Header("order_type") String orderType) {
        ...
    }
}
----

The following list shows the arguments that are available to be matched with parameters in listener endpoints:

* The raw `org.springframework.amqp.core.Message`.
* The `MessageProperties` from the raw `Message`.
* The `com.rabbitmq.client.Channel` on which the message was received.
* The `org.springframework.messaging.Message` converted from the incoming AMQP message.
* `@Header`-annotated method arguments to extract a specific header value, including standard AMQP headers.
* `@Headers`-annotated argument that must also be assignable to `java.util.Map` for getting access to all headers.
* The converted payload

A non-annotated element that is not one of the supported types (that is,
`Message`, `MessageProperties`, `Message<?>` and `Channel`) is matched with the payload.
You can make that explicit by annotating the parameter with `@Payload`.
You can also turn on validation by adding an extra `@Valid`.

The ability to inject Springâ€™s message abstraction is particularly useful to benefit from all the information stored in the transport-specific message without relying on the transport-specific API.
The following example shows how to do so:

[source,java]
----

@RabbitListener(queues = "myQueue")
public void processOrder(Message<Order> order) { ...
}

----

Handling of method arguments is provided by `DefaultMessageHandlerMethodFactory`, which you can further customize to support additional method arguments.
The conversion and validation support can be customized there as well.

For instance, if we want to make sure our `Order` is valid before processing it, we can annotate the payload with `@Valid` and configure the necessary validator, as follows:

[source,java]
----

@Configuration
@EnableRabbit
public class AppConfig implements RabbitListenerConfigurer {

    @Override
    public void configureRabbitListeners(RabbitListenerEndpointRegistrar registrar) {
        registrar.setMessageHandlerMethodFactory(myHandlerMethodFactory());
    }

    @Bean
    public DefaultMessageHandlerMethodFactory myHandlerMethodFactory() {
        DefaultMessageHandlerMethodFactory factory = new DefaultMessageHandlerMethodFactory();
        factory.setValidator(myValidator());
        return factory;
    }
}

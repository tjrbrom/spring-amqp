:page-section-summary-toc: 1

Starting with version 1.6, the `@RabbitListener` annotation is marked with `@Repeatable`.
This means that the annotation can appear on the same annotated element (method or class) multiple times.
In this case, a separate listener container is created for each annotation, each of which invokes the same listener
`@Bean`.
Repeatable annotations can be used with Java 8 or above.

= Exception Handling

Many operations with the RabbitMQ Java client can throw checked exceptions.
For example, there are a lot of cases where `IOException` instances may be thrown.
The `RabbitTemplate`, `SimpleMessageListenerContainer`, and other Spring AMQP components catch those exceptions and convert them into one of the exceptions within `AmqpException` hierarchy.
Those are defined in the 'org.springframework.amqp' package, and `AmqpException` is the base of the hierarchy.

When a listener throws an exception, it is wrapped in a `ListenerExecutionFailedException`.
Normally the message is rejected and requeued by the broker.
Setting `defaultRequeueRejected` to `false` causes messages to be discarded (or routed to a dead letter exchange).
As discussed in xref:amqp/resilience-recovering-from-errors-and-broker-failures.adoc#async-listeners[Message Listeners and the Asynchronous Case], the listener can throw an `AmqpRejectAndDontRequeueException` (or `ImmediateRequeueAmqpException`) to conditionally control this behavior.

However, there is a class of errors where the listener cannot control the behavior.
When a message that cannot be converted is encountered (for example, an invalid `content_encoding` header), some exceptions are thrown before the message reaches user code.
With `defaultRequeueRejected` set to `true` (default) (or throwing an `ImmediateRequeueAmqpException`), such messages would be redelivered over and over.
Before version 1.3.2, users needed to write a custom `ErrorHandler`, as discussed in xref:amqp/exception-handling.adoc[Exception Handling], to avoid this situation.

Starting with version 1.3.2, the default `ErrorHandler` is now a `ConditionalRejectingErrorHandler` that rejects (and does not requeue) messages that fail with an irrecoverable error.
Specifically, it rejects messages that fail with the following errors:

* `o.s.amqp...MessageConversionException`: Can be thrown when converting the incoming message payload using a `MessageConverter`.
* `o.s.messaging...MessageConversionException`: Can be thrown by the conversion service if additional conversion is required when mapping to a `@RabbitListener` method.
* `o.s.messaging...MethodArgumentNotValidException`: Can be thrown if validation (for example, `@Valid`) is used in the listener and the validation fails.
* `o.s.messaging...MethodArgumentTypeMismatchException`: Can be thrown if the inbound message was converted to a type that is not correct for the target method.
For example, the parameter is declared as `Message<Foo>` but `Message<Bar>` is received.
* `java.lang.NoSuchMethodException`: Added in version 1.6.3.
* `java.lang.ClassCastException`: Added in version 1.6.3.

You can configure an instance of this error handler with a `FatalExceptionStrategy` so that users can provide their own rules for conditional message rejection -- for example, a delegate implementation to the `BinaryExceptionClassifier` from Spring Retry (xref:amqp/resilience-recovering-from-errors-and-broker-failures.adoc#async-listeners[Message Listeners and the Asynchronous Case]).
In addition, the `ListenerExecutionFailedException` now has a `failedMessage` property that you can use in the decision.
If the `FatalExceptionStrategy.isFatal()` method returns `true`, the error handler throws an `AmqpRejectAndDontRequeueException`.
The default `FatalExceptionStrategy` logs a warning message when an exception is determined to be fatal.

Since version 1.6.3, a convenient way to add user exceptions to the fatal list is to subclass `ConditionalRejectingErrorHandler.DefaultExceptionStrategy` and override the `isUserCauseFatal(Throwable cause)` method to return `true` for fatal exceptions.

A common pattern for handling DLQ messages is to set a `time-to-live` on those messages as well as additional DLQ configuration such that these messages expire and are routed back to the main queue for retry.
The problem with this technique is that messages that cause fatal exceptions loop forever.
Starting with version 2.1, the `ConditionalRejectingErrorHandler` detects an `x-death` header on a message that causes a fatal exception to be thrown.
The message is logged and discarded.
You can revert to the previous behavior by setting the `discardFatalsWithXDeath` property on the `ConditionalRejectingErrorHandler` to `false`.

IMPORTANT: Starting with version 2.1.9, messages with these fatal exceptions are rejected and NOT requeued by default, even if the container acknowledge mode is MANUAL.
These exceptions generally occur before the listener is invoked so the listener does not have a chance to ack or nack the message so it remained in the queue in an un-acked state.
To revert to the previous behavior, set the `rejectManual` property on the `ConditionalRejectingErrorHandler` to `false`.

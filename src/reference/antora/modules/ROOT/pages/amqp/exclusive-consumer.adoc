= Exclusive Consumer
:page-section-summary-toc: 1

Starting with version 1.3, you can configure the listener container with a single exclusive consumer.
This prevents other containers from consuming from the queues until the current consumer is cancelled.
The concurrency of such a container must be `1`.

When using exclusive consumers, other containers try to consume from the queues according to the `recoveryInterval` property and log a `WARN` message if the attempt fails.

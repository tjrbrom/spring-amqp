= Containers and Broker-Named queues

While it is preferable to use `AnonymousQueue` instances as auto-delete queues, starting with version 2.1, you can use broker named queues with listener containers.
The following example shows how to do so:

[source, java]
----
@Bean
public Queue queue() {
    return new Queue("", false, true, true);
}

@Bean
public SimpleMessageListenerContainer container() {
    SimpleMessageListenerContainer container = new SimpleMessageListenerContainer(cf());
    container.setQueues(queue());
    container.setMessageListener(m -> {
        ...
    });
    container.setMissingQueuesFatal(false);
    return container;
}
----

Notice the empty `String` for the name.
When the `RabbitAdmin` declares queues, it updates the `Queue.actualName` property with the name returned by the broker.
You must use `setQueues()` when you configure the container for this to work, so that the container can access the declared name at runtime.
Just setting the names is insufficient.

NOTE: You cannot add broker-named queues to the containers while they are running.

IMPORTANT: When a connection is reset and a new one is established, the new queue gets a new name.
Since there is a race condition between the container restarting and the queue being re-declared, it is important to set the container's `missingQueuesFatal` property to `false`, since the container is likely to initially try to reconnect to the old queue.
